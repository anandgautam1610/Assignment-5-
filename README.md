TASK 1 : - 
A dictionary is created named "students" in which student name and their marks are stored as a key value pairs.
User is asked to enter the name of student and then it shows the corresponding marks of that student.
If student is not present in dictionary , it will show "Student not found".

TAK 2 :-
A list is created as "l1" with first 10 natural number. 
By using slicing method  , first five elements of list are extracted from the list and stored in "new_list" and it is printed.
Again by using slicing , elements of "new_list" are reversed and stored in "reversed_list" and it is displayed.
